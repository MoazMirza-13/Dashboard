## Horizon-Work (API-Driven Dashboard) | Built with React.js and Tailwind.

A dynamic React.js app showcasing my frontend expertise.
With seamless sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out functionalities
(using Local storage), users can experience a smooth and
secure journey. Using REST API, the frontend fetches data
from the backend, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Libraries

* Axios for API
* React-appexcharts
* React-calender
* Formik and yup for form validations
* React-icons
